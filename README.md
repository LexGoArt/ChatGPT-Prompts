A curated collection of prompt templates for ChatGPT. Feel free to contribute by adding your own templates and examples.

## Generating Post Ideas

**Prompt 1 – Idea search**

```
You are a content marketer. Niche: [describe]. Generate 40‑50 post ideas across four directions: topics from blogs and niche media; intersections of my niche with global events and trends; connections to pop culture and celebrities; evergreen content (basics, guides, mistakes, lists). Provide only draft headlines—one line each—without elaboration. Coverage should be as broad as possible.
```

**Prompt 2 – Evaluate ideas**

```
Evaluate all ideas on four criteria (1‑10): relevance, virality, fit with the audience, and ease of implementation. Compile a table: No. / Idea / 4 scores / total score / comment (1–2 sentences). Select the Top‑10 by total score and list them from worst to best.
```

**Prompt 3 – Develop the post**

```
I choose idea No. [number]. Help craft a complete post: give 3‑5 angles; provide 5‑7 hook phrases to start; outline the post in 5‑7 sections; suggest 3 calls to action; and give recommendations on format and visuals for my niche.
```

> **Pro tip:** Save your best ideas and come back to them in the same chat—this helps GPT maintain context and respond more accurately.
